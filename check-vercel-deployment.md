# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- GitHub push successful: commit `cd2e9ed` pushed to origin/main
- Vercel showing old deployment from July 23rd (5 days ago)
- Latest changes not reflected on https://250709in.vercel.app

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the "250709in" project
3. Check the deployments tab for recent deployments

### 2. Possible Issues and Solutions

#### A. GitHub Integration Disconnected
- Go to Project Settings → Git
- Verify GitHub repository is connected
- Re-connect if necessary

#### B. Build Failed
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Look for build failures or warnings

#### C. Branch Protection
- Verify deployment is set to trigger on `main` branch
- Check if automatic deployments are enabled

### 3. Manual Deployment
If automatic deployment isn't working:
1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Redeploy"
2. Or use the "Import from Git" option to trigger a new deployment

### 4. Alternative: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```
