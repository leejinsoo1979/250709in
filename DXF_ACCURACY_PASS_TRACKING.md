# DXF Accuracy Pass - Branch Management Tracking

## Branch Information
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/dxf-accuracy-pass`
- **Base Branch**: `main`
- **Created**: 2025-01-27
- **Purpose**: Centralized branch for DXF accuracy improvements and related PRs

## Branch Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Feature branch created and pushed to remote
✅ **COMPLETED**: DXF codebase analysis completed
⚠️ **PENDING**: Branch protection rules (requires GitHub CLI authentication)
⚠️ **PENDING**: PR workflow setup
⚠️ **PENDING**: DXF accuracy testing framework setup

## Repository Status
- **Current Branch**: `feature/dxf-accuracy-pass`
- **Main Branch Status**: 19 commits ahead of origin/main
- **Latest Commit**: feat: DXF Accuracy Pass branch management setup (d5bb949)

## DXF Codebase Analysis Results
**Key DXF Files Identified**: 10 core implementation files
- `src/editor/shared/utils/dxfGenerator.ts` - Main DXF generation logic
- `src/editor/shared/hooks/useDXFExport.ts` - React hook for DXF export
- `src/editor/shared/utils/dxfKoreanText.ts` - Korean text handling utilities
- `src/editor/CNCOptimizer/utils/dxfGenerator.ts` - CNC-specific DXF generation
- `src/editor/CNCOptimizer/utils/dxfExporter.ts` - CNC DXF export utilities
- `src/services/exportService.ts` - Storage and persistence service

**Accuracy Risk Assessment**: 
- **Medium Risk**: Custom dimension handling (customDepth, adjustedWidth, customWidth)
- **High Risk**: Multi-view generation (front, plan, side) with different coordinate systems
- **Medium Risk**: Korean text encoding and formatting
- **Low Risk**: Basic geometric calculations and space measurements

**Testing Gaps Identified**:
- ❌ No unit tests for DXF generation functions
- ❌ No accuracy validation tests for generated DXF output
- ❌ No integration tests for multi-view exports
- ✅ Basic HTML test file exists (`test-dxf.html`) but limited scope

## Workflow Instructions

### For Contributors
1. Create feature branches from `feature/dxf-accuracy-pass`
2. Name branches with format: `dxf-accuracy/[component]-[issue]`
3. Target PRs to `feature/dxf-accuracy-pass` branch
4. Include DXF accuracy test results in PR description

### For Reviewers
1. Verify DXF output accuracy before approval
2. Check test coverage for affected components
3. Validate changes don't break existing functionality
4. Ensure proper commit message format

## Branch Protection Rules (Pending GitHub CLI Setup)
- Require PR reviews: 1 reviewer minimum
- Require status checks: CI/build
- Restrict direct pushes to branch
- Auto-delete head branches after merge

## Recommended Development Priorities for DXF Accuracy Pass

### High Priority (Week 1)
1. **Create DXF Accuracy Test Suite** - Unit tests for coordinate calculations and dimension handling
2. **Multi-View Validation Framework** - Ensure front/plan/side views generate correctly
3. **Custom Dimension Testing** - Validate adjustedWidth, customWidth, customDepth handling

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
4. **Korean Text Encoding Tests** - Verify proper text formatting and character encoding
5. **Integration Tests** - Full export workflow testing with real furniture data
6. **Performance Testing** - Large furniture set export performance validation

### Low Priority (Week 3+)
7. **Set up GitHub CLI authentication** - For automated branch protection
8. **Configure branch protection rules** - Automated PR review requirements
9. **Create PR template specific to DXF accuracy** - Standardized PR format
10. **Set up automated testing workflow** - CI/CD integration for DXF validation

## Next Actions Required
**IMMEDIATE**: Begin monitoring for incoming PRs targeting `feature/dxf-accuracy-pass` branch
**THIS WEEK**: Create testing framework for DXF accuracy validation
**ONGOING**: Track and aggregate PR status, provide weekly status reports to owner
